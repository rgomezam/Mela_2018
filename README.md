mela3.c and mela4.c are a bit more fancy, they contain several functions and a dialague where you can choose which option you want to run (create curve, open curve that was previously created, calculate errors, etc). I think mela3 worked and mela4 didn't but I don't remember the exact difference (you can have a look at the diff of both).
